title: "The Long Game: Choose a Career That Brings Lasting Joy"

After chatting with a few people about their career paths, I found myself reflecting: If I could go back in time, would I still choose my current job? And more importantly, would the advice I gave to others actually lead me to the same career?

Like most people, I just want to live a happy and fulfilled life. That got me thinking: What if we stopped framing career decisions as a choice between money and passion? Instead, what if we come up with a framework to choose a career that brings lasting joy and fulfillment?

I believe that the key to sustained happiness in a career comes from creating _positive feedback loops_—moments where your work reinforces your sense of purpose and satisfaction. To figure out if a field/role can provide that, here are three angles to consider:

1. **Would society give me positive feedback?**
2. **Would my industry give me positive feedback?**
3. **Would I give myself positive feedback?**

These questions align with three foundational pillars: societal respect, professional excellence, and personal fulfillment. Ideally, your career satisfies all three—if not, the goal is to check as many boxes as possible.

## 1. Would society give me positive feedback?

Certain careers are inherently respected by society, which can provide a sense of validation and self-worth beyond the workplace. For example, roles like doctors, lawyers, and bankers are often revered for their competitiveness and impact. The respect they command can elevate your social standing and boost confidence in both personal and professional spheres.

## 2. Would my industry give me positive feedback?

Excelling within your field, either become you have a natural talent or competitive edge, is deeply fulfilling. You will receive recognition, promotions, and admiration from your peers - all contribute to your sense of accomplishment.

Take architects, for instance. While it might not be the most lucrative field, being one of the best changes the equation. Acclaimed architects have global recognition, work on high-budget iconic projects and have their work studied by future generations.

## 3. Would I give myself positive feedback?

This is perhaps the most introspective question: Does the work itself make you happy? Regardless of external validation, finding joy in your day-to-day activities or believing in your work’s purpose can sustain long-term happiness.

This angle can be broken into two sub-questions:

- **Do I enjoy the day-to-day activities?** For instance, if you’re a hotel reviewer and love staying in new places, the daily grind might actually feel like fun.
- **Do I believe my work serves a higher purpose?** Some roles—like scientific research or social impact work—can feel incredibly rewarding because they contribute to something bigger than yourself.

## The Missing Debate

We often hear people debating between “doing a job that makes money” (societal respect) and “doing what you love” (personal fulfillment). But we don’t talk enough about “doing what you’re good at.”

Here’s why it matters:

- Being good at something earns you recognition and opens doors in your industry.
- It can also lead to _societal respect_—people admire those who excel in their fields.
- And when you’re good at something, the positive feedback might actually make you grow to love it.

## Striking a Balance

The sweet spot is finding a career that checks multiple boxes. If you focus on just one, it might not be enough to keep you happy. For example:

- A banker who’s not performing well and doesn’t see societal value in their work might feel unfulfilled.
- A research scientist who struggles to excel might end up frustrated, even if they love the purpose of their work.

On the flip side, think about a doctor who’s great at their job, loves helping patients, and is respected by society. That’s the kind of alignment that leads to real happiness and purpose.

## Beyond Industry Choices

This framework applies not only to choosing an industry but also to evaluating career transitions. For example:

- **Starting a business:** Will your new role as a founder align with these three pillars?
- **Moving into management:** It might bring more societal respect, but if you’re not great at it or don’t enjoy the day-to-day responsibilities, it could take away from your overall happiness.

## Final Thoughts

I wrote this post while reflecting on my own career path. I’m not a career coach, nor have I extensively researched this subject—it’s simply an idea I wanted to share. If this perspective is similar to something you’ve read before, it’s likely a subconscious influence or coincidence. If you haven’t thought about career choices through this lens, I hope it was useful.
